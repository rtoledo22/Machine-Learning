This is a series of projects relating to binary classifiers, such as the Perceptron, Gradient Descents, and SVMs using sci-kit learn. The specific assignment this README is about is Assignment 4. In this assignment I am comparing two different Support Vector Models in order to classify, given a dataset of computers, whether each computer is above or below 8 GB of RAM depending on its price and its hard drive space. There is an additional Adaline Gradient Descent for comparison, though only for one series of models. In each of four different series, I changed the parameters of each SVM (excluding the initial two vs three classifiers) which include the gamma and c parameters.
